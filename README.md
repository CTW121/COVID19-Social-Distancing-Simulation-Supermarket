## COVID-19 Social Distancing Simulation with Supermarket Case  Study
A visualization tool is developed to assist store owners ans policy makers with decisions based on indoor aerosol spread of COVID-19. The interactive visualization tool is developed for a scenario concerning a supermarket.

This visualization tool is developed by using Python Dash.

The tool provides the users to create two supermarket layouts on the canvas and then running for simulation.

Parameters such as number of visited customers, entrance location, number and location of exits, and facemask types are available to be set by the users.

The visualizations of cumulative heatmaps and number of customers exposed to several aerosol levels can be displayed on the dashboard.

Following are the screenshots of the visualization tool:
